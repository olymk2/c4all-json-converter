Usage
========

```python json_converter.py Path\to\json\file.json```

When commencing this script ensure the original json file is in the same directory as the "files" folder as generated by the C4ALL data migration feature "Export Work > From Work > to Hubstream". This is required as the script seeks out the "files" folder and renames it to a unique reference to allow the stacking of multiple C4ALL cases for upload within the Hubstream Intelligence Agent.
